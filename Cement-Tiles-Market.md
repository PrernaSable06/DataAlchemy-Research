Projections suggest an accelerating shift toward more specialized and customized products as consumers demand higher aesthetic value in their spaces. Here are key drivers for growth between 2023 and 2033:</p><ul> <li><strong>Increased Demand for Sustainable Products:</strong> As governments and consumers continue to push for sustainability, demand for eco-friendly flooring options like cement tiles is expected to surge.
